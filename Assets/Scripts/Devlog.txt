DEVLOG FOR D2_game"
Nov 2022

* IDEAS
- Remake the D2 style game like Grim Dawn and Lost Relics mishmash.


21/11	* Starting with simple prototype
		* Trying to use new imput system from Unity Starter Pack Third person controller
		* Importing Miximo character and trying to replace the third person character
22/11	* Kinda Made animation work for the character
		* Added point click move behaviour for character
		* Made simple Lerp movement/rotation to points clicked
		* Shift works as input for stopping movement
		* Semismooth camera needs more tweeking	
		* Made A-D rotate camera around player.
		* Made attack imidiately face direction, maybe add fast tween before?
		* Fixed some issue with animation playing in place by adding root motion to attack.
		* Set Attack Timer to slightly less than its animation so it wont loop
23/11	* Clicking now only works for ground positions, no more tilting character?
		* Fixed so player turns if attacking during tween
		* Latest click is saved during attacklock to be executed after.
		* Made tween for attacking in new direction smooth
		* Made smooth transition into walk/run state, but its chyunky need rework.


		TODO
		* Make so stored attack isnt executed if enemy dies?

Time X Days total, X left
