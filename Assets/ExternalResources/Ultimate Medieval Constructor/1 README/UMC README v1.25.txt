Ultimate Medieval Constructor README Nature Assets Version 1.25

Nature Folder:
New nature prefabs have been added, and separated according to their types / texture sharing!
There is a wide assortment of chiseled rocks available, which are great for adding that small detail to dress up your scenes! These rocks come as separate pieces to manually place rock for rock. They also are available in grouped pieces, to quickly dress up your scenes fast and easy!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

As well, there are a new supply of rocks and cliff pieces called "Highland Rocks." These range from small to huge mountain / cliff pieces, which are great to use as mountains in the background, or for climable plateaus to use in your scenes. These come equipped with both regular style rock textures, along with texture painted mossy grass on the tops of the peaks for added detail, giving you a lot of options to work with! Later versions will include snowy tops added as well!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The rest of this update adds a lot of other nature prefabs for your environments as well! Including tons of different and colorful flowers. A few bushes and plants. Some water plants for that added detail. A few dozen different trees: Pine and Oak / Maple. And plenty of shrubbery!
