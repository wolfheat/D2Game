DEVLOG FOR D2_game"
Nov 2022

* IDEAS
- Remake the D2 style game like Grim Dawn and Lost Relics mishmash.


21/11	* Starting with simple prototype
		* Trying to use new imput system from Unity Starter Pack Third person controller
		* Importing Miximo character and trying to replace the third person character
22/11	* Kinda Made animation work for the character
		* Added point click move behaviour for character
		* Made simple Lerp movement/rotation to points clicked
		* Shift works as input for stopping movement
		* Semismooth camera needs more tweeking	
		* Made A-D rotate camera around player.
		* Made attack imidiately face direction, maybe add fast tween before?
		* Fixed some issue with animation playing in place by adding root motion to attack.
		* Set Attack Timer to slightly less than its animation so it wont loop
23/11	* Clicking now only works for ground positions, no more tilting character?
		* Fixed so player turns if attacking during tween
		* Latest click is saved during attacklock to be executed after.
		* Made tween for attacking in new direction smooth
		* Made smooth transition into walk/run state, but its chyunky need rework.
24/11	* Rewrote PLayerMoveTowards but still needs some fixes. Small steps staggers, sometime pleyer dont reach goal.
		* System for recognizing held mousebutton implemented, works for both walk and attack and triggers ever x's by timer
		* Added Waypoint marker for valid movement thats placed on click point and animated once. Also System For changing type.
		* Waypoint now show as red if attack is used/stored and green if movement is used/stored.

		TODO
		* Make so stored attack isnt executed if enemy dies?
		* Make enemy with animation
		* Make simple leveldesign
		* Add SoundEffects to attack, footstep, etc

Time X Days total, X left
