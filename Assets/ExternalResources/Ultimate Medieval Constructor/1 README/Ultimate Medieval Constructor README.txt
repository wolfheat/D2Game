Ultimate Medieval Constructor: (README)

Important Notes, and Key Features:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Folder organization:

IMPORTANT. Read this first, to prevent you from getting lost in the files structure!
Each category is organized appropriately throughout the file structure, ex: Castles, Housing, Props, Nature, etc.. For each category, they are broken down into 3 folders each, named: "Wood Dark," "Wood Light," "Wood Old."

This was made this way for an easier way to find prefabs associated with their corresponding materials attached! Since there are 3 main materials included, you have this fast / efficient way of selecting the prefabs that work for your scene, rather than having to go and change each material according to what looks you are trying to have in your scenes!


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Levels of Building:

"Level of Building" is a key feature in this package, and you will find folders in the package with this name. These prefabs are made / created in different levels or "stages" for their looks. These prefabs are great for adding nice detail to your scenes, and also support full interiors, for both housing and castles!
In some cases, you may want to build a scene that is "under construction" with many buildings and structures that are "incomplete," and either over time in your game, or when you collect more resources, these structures will have the "next level" of build looks available!

This is especially great for survival games, or In-Game-Housing. If the character goes to build a house, then they only have level 1 walls available, until they either get more resources, or level up perhaps?

Not only do you get the main 2 types of builds included (Wood, and Stone), but also a large supply of roofs! Some of these roofs even have their own "levels of building" with lvl 1 roofs constisting of just wooden foundations, and lvl 3 roofs, fully complete, with interior wooden beams supporting the structure! These are great for hanging lanterns insed of your houses on the upper floors, for addded decorations.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Fast Housing / Castles:

Fast housing / castles are for the exterior builds in your scenes. There are close to 100 total castle and house walls available to use. These models are great for quickly creating many different type looks for houses in a small or large town. But also great for Castle Walls to decorate the exterior parts of your scenes!
House walls come in multiple sizes and floors, for easier building. There are wooden pillars available to place in between each wall, for added detail!

Full support for roofing, consisting of many different types and sizes for the roofs. Along with house extensions, and wooden deck support. allowing you to make custom houses, very original, and with many different looks / alterations!


-------------------------------------------------------------------

The rest of the package is organized accordingly!

---If you are in need of lanterns, fences, crates, barrels, etc.. Check the "props" folder, and you will find much of what you need!

---If you are looking to dress up your scenes with some marketplace supplies, like food or cloth awnings, check the "Marketplace" folder, for many different type food items, included food barrels, which are great for quickly dressing up your scenes!

---Trying to understand the best way to use some of these house wall models? See the "Modules" folder (near the top of the file structure) for many different modules that I built for you in Unity, that you may take apart or change materials as needed!

---It may seem busy at first, but the file structure is built accordingly. This allows for easier updates in the future. If i add more textures, I'll add the corresponding Folder to allow you to find the new models / materials much easier. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

And the best part, I am always accepting requests. I will try and add what I can that is asked of me, if i think that it works / blends well with the package itself. Don't be afraid to ask me any questions, or just give some input about things you may want to see / changed.
