DEVLOG FOR D2_game"
Nov 2022

* IDEAS
- Remake the D2 style game like Grim Dawn and Lost Relics mishmash.


21/11	* Starting with simple prototype
		* Trying to use new imput system from Unity Starter Pack Third person controller
		* Importing Miximo character and trying to replace the third person character
22/11	* Kinda Made animation work for the character
		* Added point click move behaviour for character
		* Made simple Lerp movement/rotation to points clicked
		* Shift works as input for stopping movement
		* Semismooth camera needs more tweeking	
		* Made A-D rotate camera around player.
		* Made attack imidiately face direction, maybe add fast tween before?
		* Fixed some issue with animation playing in place by adding root motion to attack.
		* Set Attack Timer to slightly less than its animation so it wont loop
23/11	* Clicking now only works for ground positions, no more tilting character?
		* Fixed so player turns if attacking during tween
		* Latest click is saved during attacklock to be executed after.
		* Made tween for attacking in new direction smooth
		* Made smooth transition into walk/run state, but its chyunky need rework.
24/11	* Rewrote PLayerMoveTowards but still needs some fixes. Small steps staggers, sometime pleyer dont reach goal.
		* System for recognizing held mousebutton implemented, works for both walk and attack and triggers ever x's by timer
		* Added Waypoint marker for valid movement thats placed on click point and animated once. Also System For changing type.
		* Waypoint now show as red if attack is used/stored and green if movement is used/stored.
25/11	* Added SoundMaster that handles Main Music and SFX. Added Footsteps.
		* Different Sound for missing and hitting with attack swing.
		* Made So waypoint only shows when releasing mouse to prevent spam on holding. Better?
30/11	* Finally made player character move correctly with regard to move/attack and rotate. Not really working...
		* Semi working solution for player to stop moving at walls.
		* Fixed turning angle never reached. By checking proxarity. Fixed issue with not storing attack.
1/12	* Made simple enemy waypoint system for attacking when in range and using waypoints for moving.
2/12	* Made new animator controller script for enemy to handle behaviour. Can use navmech spots for 
			patrol and engage in chase and bow attack when player gets close.
5/12	* Made larger testarea with tiles.
		* Added Spawner of enemies that spawn a new enemy when pressing Space, Enemies get random spawn and waypoint
6/12	* Made decals and debree spawn randomely on the game area
7/12	* Made the NavMesh baked/generated at runtime by using NavMeshSurface from custom git download
9/12	* Made Enemy colliders disable when they die
19/12	* Rewrote player to have navagent instead of character controller
20/12	* Added states for player and made it work for basic animations
		* NEXT - Remake animator for player and code to use states like enemy does
27/12	* Found out I needed NavMesh-Obstacle component for items to block when using navmech-agent movement
29/12	* Made attack even if not clicking on walkable spot
		* Made smooth transition for enemy animator
		* Clicking under an object makes player never reach target and just keep animating movement. Solved with navmesh obstacle carving
1/1		* Created 3 step rooms with encounter in middle, fixed doorways between but bad manual positioning of doors.
2/1		* Player can now gather with G if close enough to node
		* Gathering is interrupted if new input during gathering
9/1		* Made animationEvents for player steps and swordAttack.
		* Made separare footstep calls for audio
10/1	* Fixed Enemy not switching between states correctly 
		* Raycast semi-works. Seems not accurate. Enemy lose hold of player when player moves.
11/1	* Enemy Raycast now works, but cant register player when attackcollider is visable, fix with layers later?
		* Made Enemy not able to attack through walls.
		* Made it so arrows now stop att walls and connect to player if player is hit. Might need better precision.
12/1	* If only one enemy no errors trying to do move to player when dead, but with many enemies that dies similtaniously f1ixed
		* Made player move to node before mining if to far away, can be interrupted with a stop atm
20/1	* Rewrote PlayerController making the statemachine/transition between action smoother and easier to add to.
		* Added powerattack to player when rightclicking
		* Changed gather sound to appropritate sound
23/1	* Rewrote player and enemy class by extracting states
25/1	* Made player turn towards attackpoint at fixed speed before attacking

		// Need to fix up saving system. Store save file in SO during gameplay and store to file from that?
		// Need some system that stores all items in game.	(Semi started, Item Library added)
							
		
		// Make Cooking work, maybe UI for it? Maybe do cook animation and entire cook transfer at the end if available?

		// Make Cooked meat work as consumable


		// --- --- TODO --- ---
				
		// Add more Interfaces

		// - Content -
		// Load Screen between scenes

		// - Mechanics Stuff -
		
		// Sometimes if player dont fully reach stash or target he keeps using moving animation without moving
		// Player can get stuck sometimes fix, fixed?
		// Add tools for harvesting.
		// Change arrow shooting sound
		// Make bow animation better, change speed of animation?
		// Can keep shooting arrows with left click but not rightclick
		// Make Hitpoints text show when hitting enemy or getting hit yourself, over time damage etc
		// Arrows stop at the player collider, maybe should stick to the actual character instead
		// Make so Enemy stops chase earlier if player is not visable.

		// - Data stuff -
		// Check for bugs in stash reloading after making it more efficient

		// - Animation Stuff -
		// Make variants in attack animation (Power attack hit harder and larger with other animation/time to complete?)
		// Fix gliding issue with animation while moving (fixed?)
		// Screen jumps/flickers when animating attack.
		// Attack animation has strange foot movements - Might be solved by bake root animation on animation

		// - Terrain -
		// Tried a lot of grass variants, remove the ones not needed, clean up project
		// Terrain clips in dungeon level, something wrong with camera not rendering it correctly
		// Redo Grass in Town, Grass texture has artifacs
		// Check for to high resolution in all assets, lower them down for performance

		// - Items Stuff -
		// Make Objects droppable by enemies
		// Items sprite are scaled to square size so long items wont scale correctly.
		
		//  - LevelCreation Stuff -
		// The remove all children method for clearing doorways removes ground for cracked tile floor.
		// Make it so tiles dont have enemies, resources, obstacles only one on each
		// Maybe have certain rooms spawn enemies and not the added corridor?
		// Limit obstacles from spawning in front of doorways


		//  - Maybe dont do these Stuff - 
		// Better to use A* alg to find shortest path with weights
		// Preplaces Unused Rooms should be lower cost to move through
