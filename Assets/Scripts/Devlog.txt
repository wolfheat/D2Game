DEVLOG FOR D2_game"
Nov 2022

* IDEAS
- Remake the D2 style game like Grim Dawn and Lost Relics mishmash.


21/11	* Starting with simple prototype
		* Trying to use new imput system from Unity Starter Pack Third person controller
		* Importing Miximo character and trying to replace the third person character
22/11	* Kinda Made animation work for the character
		* Added point click move behaviour for character
		* Made simple Lerp movement/rotation to points clicked
		* Shift works as input for stopping movement
		* Semismooth camera needs more tweeking	
		* Made A-D rotate camera around player.
		* Made attack imidiately face direction, maybe add fast tween before?
		* Fixed some issue with animation playing in place by adding root motion to attack.
		* Set Attack Timer to slightly less than its animation so it wont loop
23/11	* Clicking now only works for ground positions, no more tilting character?
		* Fixed so player turns if attacking during tween
		* Latest click is saved during attacklock to be executed after.
		* Made tween for attacking in new direction smooth
		* Made smooth transition into walk/run state, but its chyunky need rework.
24/11	* Rewrote PLayerMoveTowards but still needs some fixes. Small steps staggers, sometime pleyer dont reach goal.
		* System for recognizing held mousebutton implemented, works for both walk and attack and triggers ever x's by timer
		* Added Waypoint marker for valid movement thats placed on click point and animated once. Also System For changing type.
		* Waypoint now show as red if attack is used/stored and green if movement is used/stored.
25/11	* Added SoundMaster that handles Main Music and SFX. Added Footsteps.
		* Different Sound for missing and hitting with attack swing.
		* Made So waypoint only shows when releasing mouse to prevent spam on holding. Better?
30/11	* Finally made player character move correctly with regard to move/attack and rotate. Not really working...
		* Semi working solution for player to stop moving at walls.
		* Fixed turning angle never reached. By checking proxarity. Fixed issue with not storing attack.
1/12	* Made simple enemy waypoint system for attacking when in range and using waypoints for moving.
2/12	* Made new animator controller script for enemy to handle behaviour. Can use navmech spots for 
			patrol and engage in chase and bow attack when player gets close.
5/12	* Made larger testarea with tiles.
		* Added Spawner of enemies that spawn a new enemy when pressing Space, Enemies get random spawn and waypoint
6/12	* Made decals and debree spawn randomely on the game area
7/12	* Made the NavMesh baked/generated at runtime by using NavMeshSurface from custom git download
9/12	* Made Enemy colliders disable when they die
19/12	* Rewrote player to have navagent instead of character controller
20/12	* Added states for player and made it work for basic animations
		* NEXT - Remake animator for player and code to use states like enemy does
27/12	* Found out I needed NavMesh-Obstacle component for items to block when using navmech-agent movement
29/12	* Made attack even if not clicking on walkable spot
		* Made smooth transition for enemy animator
		* Clicking under an object makes player never reach target and just keep animating movement. Solved with navmesh obstacle carving
1/1		* Created 3 step rooms with encounter in middle, fixed doorways between but bad manual positioning of doors.
2/1		* Player can now gather with G if close enough to node
		* Gathering is interrupted if new input during gathering
9/1		* Made animationEvents for player steps and swordAttack.
		* Made separare footstep calls for audio
10/1	* Fixed Enemy not switching between states correctly 
		* Raycast semi-works. Seems not accurate. Enemy lose hold of player when player moves.
11/1	* Enemy Raycast now works, but cant register player when attackcollider is visable, fix with layers later?
		* Made Enemy not able to attack through walls.
		* Made it so arrows now stop att walls and connect to player if player is hit. Might need better precision.
12/1	* If only one enemy no errors trying to do move to player when dead, but with many enemies that dies similtaniously f1ixed
		* Made player move to node before mining if to far away, can be interrupted with a stop atm
20/1	* Rewrote PlayerController making the statemachine/transition between action smoother and easier to add to.
		* Added powerattack to player when rightclicking
		* Changed gather sound to appropritate sound
23/1	* Rewrote player and enemy class by extracting states
25/1	* Made player turn towards attackpoint at fixed speed before attacking
		* Fixed enemy chasing layer when close, was seeing the arrows and not player when raytracing. Disabled colliders.
		* Added random direction for enemy shooting arrow
22/3	* Added Zoom in different steps by scroll wheel.
24/3	* Made new levelgenerator using HashSet.
		* Updated Random Generation
25/3	* Added New Generation Algorithm, Separating rooms
26/3	* Adding Delunay computation
		* Removed StartTriangles in Delunay
27/3	* Separated main and rest triangles for main room and possible addon rooms for corridors later
4/4		* Delunay Working, also Made simple Pathway generation between rooms that forms straight lines
5/4		* Tried new method for selecting secondary rooms. Creating Gameobjects and running IntersectLine by Rays.
6/4		* Selecting secondary rooms by simple position code now.
		* Added array for all level and checking which tiles that should be additional corridors and adding them.
		* Simple addition of walls, need to fix walls between andjecent rooms of same type and doorways
9/4		* Walls now works so that there is a 1 tile doorway between different roomtypes.
		* Minor code fixup
		* Only Main rooms have walls between rooms, restrooms and corridors only have outer walls.
10/4	* Limited size of array around actual rooms
11/4	* Enemy SpawnPoints Generated
12/4	* Lower walls in corridors added		
13/4	* Created fast way to determine player start and endportal, 
		* Limited enemy spawn positions away from start position
		* Made terrain under level that merge with play area.
14/4	* Terrain now has a small ledge around buildings that look more natural.
15/4	* Moved directory
16/4	* Added UI popup when reaching portal. Pressing ok will make new level.
17/4	* Fixed terrain issue by having separate terrain for editor and runtime mode.

		// TODO
		// Player can get stuck sometimes fix
		// Maybe have certain rooms spawn enemies and not the added corridor?
		// Limit obstacles from spawning in front of doorways

		// Make Hitpoints text show when hitting enemy or getting hit yourself, over time damage etc

		// Make Objects scavangeble and droppabe by enemies

		// Make inventory for objects, and general UI

		// PathWays working but are just angled straight lines between rooms
		// Better to use A* alg to find shortest path with weights
		// Preplaces Unused Rooms should be lower cost to move through

		* TODO: Implement Minimum Spanning Tree

		* Game can lock up sometimes, why? Prob because of inf loop in player action move/attack
		* Arrows stop at the player collider, maybe should stick to the actual character instead
		* When they turn they turn instantly make smooth?

todo	
		* Make so Enemy stops chase earlier if player is not visable.

		* Make switching weapons for player (W)
		* Make player Shooting Arrows work, fix arrow and sound

		TODO MAYOR PARTS		
		* MAKE NODES THAT CAN BE HARVESTED - 
		* MAKE BOW ANIMATION WORK AND SHOOT ARROWS

		TODO
		* Make variants in attack animation
		* Fix gliding issue with animation while moving
		* Make simple leveldesign

		CHECKLIST FOR BETTER PLAYER EXPERIENCE

		* BUGS, CRASHES, SLOW PERFORMANCE
		* MISLEADING MARKETING
		* NOT ENGAGING WITH COMMUNITY
		* CONFIGURABLE CONTROLS, 
		* TEXT TO SMALL, 
		* CONTRAST, 
		* MISSING FEATURE
